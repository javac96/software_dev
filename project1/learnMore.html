                    <h3>Self-Care Strategies for Mental Wellness</h3>
                    
                    <p>Taking care of your mental health is just as important as caring for your physical health. Here are some effective self-care strategies:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Maintain a healthy lifestyle</strong> - Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep are fundamental to good mental health.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice mindfulness</strong> - Mindfulness techniques such as meditation can help reduce stress and improve focus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Connect with others</strong> - Social connections provide emotional support and a sense of belonging.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set boundaries</strong> - Learn to say no to additional responsibilities when you're overwhelmed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Engage in activities you enjoy</strong> - Make time for hobbies and activities that bring you joy and relaxation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit media consumption</strong> - Constant exposure to news and social media can increase anxiety and stress.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice gratitude</strong> - Regularly acknowledging things you're grateful for can improve your outlook on life.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Remember that self-care is not selfish; it's necessary for maintaining your wellbeing and being able to care for others effectively.</p>

                    <h3>When to Seek Professional Help</h3>
                    
                    <p>While self-care strategies are important, sometimes professional help is necessary. Consider seeking professional help if:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your symptoms are severe or persistent</li>
                        <li>Your daily functioning is significantly impaired</li>
                        <li>You're using substances to cope</li>
                        <li>You're experiencing thoughts of harming yourself or others</li>
                        <li>Self-help strategies aren't providing relief</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Professional help can come in various forms, including therapy, counseling, and medication. The right approach depends on your specific situation and needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows that you value your wellbeing and are taking steps to improve your quality of life.</p>
